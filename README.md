# devTinder

The devTinder is a project which is built upon `node.js` for backend and `react` for fontend.

## Folder Structure

Basically the fontend and backend projects are to be kept in separate repos. But I am keeping my backend and fontend projects in the single repo for my learning purpose.

The folder structure looks like below where each of the folder can be treated as separate projects.

```
    /devTinder
        /server         # backend [Node.js]
        /client-web     # frontend web [React]
        /client-mob     # frontend mobile [React Native or Android app]
```
